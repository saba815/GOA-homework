'''A while loop is like a repeating rule. It keeps doing something again and again until a certain condition is no longer 
true. Imagine a clock ticking—it keeps ticking while time is moving!'''

'''How do we create a while loop?
Here are the steps to make one:

Make a counter (a number that changes).
Write the while keyword (this starts the loop).
Add a condition (tell the loop when to stop).
Write what you want the loop to do (print, add numbers, etc.).
Change the counter (so the loop doesn’t go forever).'''

'''What can we use it for?
Counting numbers.
Making games.
Repeating actions (like asking a question until the user gives a correct answer).'''

'''What is a counter variable?
A counter variable is a number that helps the loop know when to stop. It starts at a value and changes every time the loop runs.'''

'''The counter in my code is number.'''
