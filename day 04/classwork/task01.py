#now the problems explained

#first code - there wasnt any name 2 or surname so where did it take that information from? we didint put "" so it wasnt a string 
# it was a variable.

#second code - the second code had the same problem as the first code just a diffrent name and diffren variable.

#the third code - You could not add an integer to a string that was the problem.

#the fourth code - it had the same problem as the first and the second code the only diffrence is that the variables were 
# named city.

#the last code - the same problem as the first second and the fourth just diffren names.
